# Project Title: Fully Connected Neural Network for Binding Affinity Prediction from Molecular Fingerprints

Name: Daniel Eduardo Garzon Otero

The need for accurate prediction of binding affinity is crucial in drug discovery and design. In this project, I aim to improve the accuracy of binding affinity prediction compared to existing methods by using molecular fingerprints and a fully connected neural network. The results of this project could contribute to the development of more effective drugs and therapies.

# Dataset
The PDB_Bind database, which contains information about protein-ligand interactions obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Specifically, I will use the PDBBind dataset provided by Dr. Camille Bilodeau. The dataset will be processed and prepared for training the neural network model.

# Goals
Dataset processing: Utilize the pandas library and a Python class to set up and preprocess the dataset.
Deep learning: Train a fully connected neural network model using the preprocessed and engineered data. PyTorch library will be used for implementing the neural network.
Hyperparameter selection: Depending on the model's performance, modify the hyperparameters or adjust the model architecture to improve accuracy.
Model evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using performance metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and Pearson correlation coefficient. Sklearn and Scipy libraries will be used for calculating these metrics.
Visualization: Utilize the Matplotlib library to visualize the data and interpret the results of the analysis.
